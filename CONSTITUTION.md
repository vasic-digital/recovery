# CONSTITUTION — Recovery

## INHERITED FROM constitution/Constitution.md

All rules in `constitution/Constitution.md` (and the `constitution/Constitution.md` it references) apply unconditionally. This file's rules below extend them — they MUST NOT weaken any inherited rule. See parent root `CLAUDE.md` §6.AD for the Lava-specific incorporation context (29th §6.L cycle, 2026-05-14) and §6.AD-debt for the implementation-gap inventory. Use `constitution/find_constitution.sh` from the parent project root to resolve the absolute path of the submodule from any nested location.

Project-specific governance for the **Recovery** repository. This document carries the Universal Mandatory Constraints inherited from the cross-project root.


## Universal Mandatory Constraints

These rules are inherited from the cross-project Universal Mandatory Development Constraints (canonical source: `/tmp/UNIVERSAL_MANDATORY_RULES.md`, derived from the HelixAgent root `CLAUDE.md`). They are non-negotiable across every project, submodule, and sibling repository. Project-specific addenda are welcome but cannot weaken or override these.

### Hard Stops (permanent, non-negotiable)

1. **NO CI/CD pipelines.** No `.github/workflows/`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `Jenkinsfile`, `.travis.yml`, `.circleci/`, or any automated pipeline. No Git hooks either. All builds and tests run manually or via Makefile / script targets.
2. **NO HTTPS for Git.** SSH URLs only (`git@github.com:…`, `git@gitlab.com:…`, etc.) for clones, fetches, pushes, and submodule operations. Including for public repos. SSH keys are configured on every service.
3. **NO manual container commands.** Container orchestration is owned by the project's binary / orchestrator (e.g. `make build` → `./bin/<app>`). Direct `docker`/`podman start|stop|rm` and `docker-compose up|down` are prohibited as workflows. The orchestrator reads its configured `.env` and brings up everything.

### Mandatory Development Standards

1. **100% Test Coverage.** Every component MUST have unit, integration, E2E, automation, security/penetration, and benchmark tests. No false positives. Mocks/stubs ONLY in unit tests; all other test types use real data and live services.
2. **Challenge Coverage.** Every component MUST have Challenge scripts (`./challenges/scripts/`) validating real-life use cases. No false success — validate actual behavior, not return codes.
3. **Real Data.** Beyond unit tests, all components MUST use actual API calls, real databases, live services. No simulated success. Fallback chains tested with actual failures.
4. **Health & Observability.** Every service MUST expose health endpoints. Circuit breakers for all external dependencies. Prometheus / OpenTelemetry integration where applicable.
5. **Documentation & Quality.** Update `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and relevant docs alongside code changes. Pass language-appropriate format/lint/security gates. Conventional Commits: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`.
6. **Validation Before Release.** Pass the project's full validation suite (`make ci-validate-all`-equivalent) plus all challenges (`./challenges/scripts/run_all_challenges.sh`).
7. **No Mocks or Stubs in Production.** Mocks, stubs, fakes, placeholder classes, TODO implementations are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN in production code. All production code is fully functional with real integrations. Only unit tests may use mocks/stubs.
8. **Comprehensive Verification.** Every fix MUST be verified from all angles: runtime testing (actual HTTP requests / real CLI invocations), compile verification, code structure checks, dependency existence checks, backward compatibility, and no false positives in tests or challenges. Grep-only validation is NEVER sufficient.
9. **Resource Limits for Tests & Challenges (CRITICAL).** ALL test and challenge execution MUST be strictly limited to 30-40% of host system resources. Use `GOMAXPROCS=2`, `nice -n 19`, `ionice -c 3`, `-p 1` for `go test`. Container limits required. The host runs mission-critical processes — exceeding limits causes system crashes.
10. **Bugfix Documentation.** All bug fixes MUST be documented in `docs/issues/fixed/BUGFIXES.md` (or the project's equivalent) with root cause analysis, affected files, fix description, and a link to the verification test/challenge.
11. **Real Infrastructure for All Non-Unit Tests.** Mocks/fakes/stubs/placeholders MAY be used ONLY in unit tests (files ending `_test.go` run under `go test -short`, equivalent for other languages). ALL other test types — integration, E2E, functional, security, stress, chaos, challenge, benchmark, runtime verification — MUST execute against the REAL running system with REAL containers, REAL databases, REAL services, and REAL HTTP calls. Non-unit tests that cannot connect to real services MUST skip (not fail).
12. **Reproduction-Before-Fix (CONST-032 — MANDATORY).** Every reported error, defect, or unexpected behavior MUST be reproduced by a Challenge script BEFORE any fix is attempted. Sequence: (1) Write the Challenge first. (2) Run it; confirm fail (it reproduces the bug). (3) Then write the fix. (4) Re-run; confirm pass. (5) Commit Challenge + fix together. The Challenge becomes the regression guard for that bug forever.
13. **Concurrent-Safe Containers (Go-specific, where applicable).** Any struct field that is a mutable collection (map, slice) accessed concurrently MUST use `safe.Store[K,V]` / `safe.Slice[T]` from `digital.vasic.concurrency/pkg/safe` (or the project's equivalent primitives). Bare `sync.Mutex + map/slice` combinations are prohibited for new code.

### Definition of Done (universal)

A change is NOT done because code compiles and tests pass. "Done" requires pasted terminal output from a real run, produced in the same session as the change.

- **No self-certification.** Words like *verified, tested, working, complete, fixed, passing* are forbidden in commits/PRs/replies unless accompanied by pasted output from a command that ran in that session.
- **Demo before code.** Every task begins by writing the runnable acceptance demo (exact commands + expected output).
- **Real system, every time.** Demos run against real artifacts.
- **Skips are loud.** `t.Skip` / `@Ignore` / `xit` / `describe.skip` without a trailing `SKIP-OK: #<ticket>` comment break validation.
- **Evidence in the PR.** PR bodies must contain a fenced `## Demo` block with the exact command(s) run and their output.

<!-- BEGIN host-power-management addendum (CONST-033) -->

### CONST-033 — Host Power Management is Forbidden

**Status:** Mandatory. Non-negotiable. Applies to every project,
submodule, container entry point, build script, test, challenge, and
systemd unit shipped from this repository.

**Rule:** No code in this repository may invoke a host-level power-
state transition (suspend, hibernate, hybrid-sleep, suspend-then-
hibernate, poweroff, halt, reboot, kexec) on the host machine. This
includes — but is not limited to:

- `systemctl {suspend,hibernate,hybrid-sleep,suspend-then-hibernate,poweroff,halt,reboot,kexec}`
- `loginctl {suspend,hibernate,hybrid-sleep,suspend-then-hibernate,poweroff,halt,reboot}`
- `pm-{suspend,hibernate,suspend-hybrid}`
- `shutdown {-h,-r,-P,-H,now,--halt,--poweroff,--reboot}`
- DBus calls to `org.freedesktop.login1.Manager.{Suspend,Hibernate,HybridSleep,SuspendThenHibernate,PowerOff,Reboot}`
- DBus calls to `org.freedesktop.UPower.{Suspend,Hibernate,HybridSleep}`
- `gsettings set ... sleep-inactive-{ac,battery}-type` to any value other than `'nothing'` or `'blank'`

**Why:** The host runs mission-critical parallel CLI-agent and
container workloads. On 2026-04-26 18:23:43 the host was auto-
suspended by the GDM greeter's idle policy mid-session, killing
HelixAgent and 41 dependent services. Recurring memory-pressure
SIGKILLs of `user@1000.service` (perceived as "logged out") have the
same outcome. Auto-suspend, hibernate, and any power-state transition
are unsafe for this host.

**Defence in depth (mandatory artifacts in every project):**
1. `scripts/host-power-management/install-host-suspend-guard.sh` —
   privileged installer, manual prereq, run once per host with sudo.
   Masks `sleep.target`, `suspend.target`, `hibernate.target`,
   `hybrid-sleep.target`; writes `AllowSuspend=no` drop-in; sets
   logind `IdleAction=ignore` and `HandleLidSwitch=ignore`.
2. `scripts/host-power-management/user_session_no_suspend_bootstrap.sh` —
   per-user, no-sudo defensive layer. Idempotent. Safe to source from
   `start.sh` / `setup.sh` / `bootstrap.sh`.
3. `scripts/host-power-management/check-no-suspend-calls.sh` —
   static scanner. Exits non-zero on any forbidden invocation.
4. `challenges/scripts/host_no_auto_suspend_challenge.sh` — asserts
   the running host's state matches layer-1 masking.
5. `challenges/scripts/no_suspend_calls_challenge.sh` — wraps the
   scanner as a challenge that runs in CI / `run_all_challenges.sh`.

**Enforcement:** Every project's CI / `run_all_challenges.sh`
equivalent MUST run both challenges (host state + source tree). A
violation in either channel blocks merge. Adding files to the
scanner's `EXCLUDE_PATHS` requires an explicit justification comment
identifying the non-host context.

**See also:** `docs/HOST_POWER_MANAGEMENT.md` for full background and
runbook.

## Sixth Law — Real User Verification (Anti-Pseudo-Test Rule)

> Inherits from the root project's Anti-Bluff Testing Pact and the cross-project
> universal mandate (CONST-035). Submodule rules below are additive, never
> relaxing.

A test that passes while the feature it covers is broken for end users is the
most expensive kind of test in this codebase — it converts unknown breakage into
believed safety. This has happened in consuming projects before: tests and
Integration Challenge Tests executed green while large parts of the product
were unusable on a real device. That outcome is a constitutional failure, not a
coverage failure, and it MUST NOT recur in any module that depends on or is
depended on by this one.

Every test added MUST satisfy ALL of the following. Violation of any of them is
a release blocker, irrespective of coverage metrics, CI status, reviewer
sign-off, or schedule pressure.

1. **Same surfaces the user touches.** The test must traverse the production
   code path the user's action triggers, end to end, with no shortcut that
   bypasses real wiring.

2. **Provably falsifiable on real defects.** Before merging, the author MUST
   run the test once with the underlying feature deliberately broken (throw
   inside the function, return the wrong row, return the wrong status) and
   confirm the test fails with a clear assertion message. The PR description
   MUST state which deliberate break was used and what failure the test
   produced. A test that cannot be made to fail by breaking the thing it claims
   to verify is a bluff test by definition.

3. **Primary assertion on user-visible state.** The chief failure signal MUST
   be on something a real consumer could see or measure: rendered output,
   persisted database row, HTTP response body / status / header, file written
   to disk, packet on the wire. "Mock was invoked N times" is a permitted
   secondary assertion, never the primary one.

4. **Integration / Challenge tests are the load-bearing acceptance gate.** A
   green Challenge Test means a real consumer can complete the flow against
   real services — not "the wiring compiles". A feature for which a Challenge
   Test cannot be written is, by definition, not shippable.

5. **CI green is necessary, not sufficient.** Before any release tag is cut, a
   human (or a scripted black-box runner) MUST have exercised the feature
   end-to-end and observed the user-visible outcome.

6. **Inheritance.** This rule applies recursively to every consumer of this
   submodule. Consumer constitutions MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax
   this one.

## Seventh Law inheritance (Anti-Bluff Enforcement, 2026-04-30)

In addition to the Sixth Law above, this submodule inherits Lava's **Seventh Law — Tests MUST Confirm User-Reachable Functionality (Anti-Bluff Enforcement)** when consumed by the Lava project (`vasic-digital/Lava`). The Seventh Law was added to Lava's `CLAUDE.md` on 2026-04-30 to mechanically enforce the Sixth Law: every test commit MUST carry a Bluff-Audit stamp (mutation/observed-failure/reverted protocol); every feature MUST pass a real-stack verification gate; release tags MUST be preceded by a real-device attestation; forbidden test patterns (mocking the SUT, verification-only assertions, ignored tests without follow-up, build-success-as-only-assertion) are pre-push-rejected; a recurring bluff hunt and a bluff discovery protocol apply.

The authoritative verbatim text lives in the parent Lava `CLAUDE.md` under "Seventh Law — Tests MUST Confirm User-Reachable Functionality (Anti-Bluff Enforcement)". This submodule MAY add stricter clauses but MUST NOT relax any of the seven Seventh-Law clauses. Both the submodule's own anti-bluff rules and Lava's Sixth + Seventh Laws are binding when consumed by Lava; the stricter of the two applies.

## Clause 6.L — Anti-Bluff Functional Reality Mandate (Operator's Standing Order)

Inherited verbatim from parent Lava `/CLAUDE.md` §6.L. The operator has invoked this mandate **TWENTY-THREE TIMES** across two working days. The 10th invocation (2026-05-05, after Phase 7 readiness was reported, when the operator commissioned the full rebuild-and-test-everything cycle for tag Lava-Android-1.2.3): "Rebuild Go API and client app(s), put new builds into releases dir (with properly updated version codes) and execute all existing tests and Challenges! Any issue that pops up MUST BE properly addressed by addressing the root causes (fixing them) and covering everything with validation and verification tests and Challenges!"

Every test, every Challenge Test, every CI gate added to or maintained in this submodule MUST do exactly one job: confirm the feature it claims to cover actually works for an end user, end-to-end, on the gating matrix. CI green is necessary, NEVER sufficient. Tests must guarantee the product works — anything else is theatre.

Inheritance is recursive. Sub-submodules MAY paste this clause verbatim; they MUST NOT abbreviate or relax it.

## Clause 6.O (added 2026-05-05, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.O — Crashlytics-Resolved Issue Coverage Mandate** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.O. Every Crashlytics-recorded issue (fatal OR non-fatal) closed/resolved by any commit MUST gain (a) a validation test in the language of the crashing surface that reproduces the conditions, (b) a Challenge Test under `app/src/androidTest/kotlin/lava/app/challenges/` (client) or `tests/e2e/` (server) that drives the same user-facing path, and (c) a closure log at `.lava-ci-evidence/crashlytics-resolved/<date>-<slug>.md` recording the issue ID, root-cause analysis, fix commit SHA, and links to the tests. `scripts/tag.sh` MUST refuse release tags whose CHANGELOG mentions Crashlytics fixes without matching closure logs. Marking a Crashlytics issue "closed" in the Console requires the test coverage to land first — never close-mark before the regression-immunity tests exist. Forensic anchor: 2026-05-05, 2 Crashlytics-recorded crashes within minutes of the first Firebase-instrumented APK distribution (Lava-Android-1.2.3-1023, commit `e9de508`); post-mortem at `.lava-ci-evidence/crashlytics-resolved/2026-05-05-firebase-init-hardening.md`. The operator's ELEVENTH §6.L invocation made this clause load-bearing.

## Clause 6.P (added 2026-05-05, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.P — Distribution Versioning + Changelog Mandate** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.P. Every distribute action (Firebase App Distribution, container registry pushes, releases/ snapshots, scripts/tag.sh) MUST: (1) carry a strictly increasing versionCode (no re-distribution of already-published codes); (2) include a CHANGELOG entry — canonical file `CHANGELOG.md` at repo root + per-version snapshot at `.lava-ci-evidence/distribute-changelog/<channel>/<version>-<code>.md`; (3) inject the changelog into the App Distribution release-notes via `--release-notes`. `scripts/firebase-distribute.sh` REFUSES to operate when current versionCode ≤ last-distributed versionCode for the channel, OR when CHANGELOG.md lacks an entry for the current version, OR when the per-version snapshot file is missing. `scripts/tag.sh` enforces the same gates pre-tag. Re-distributing the same versionCode is forbidden across distribute sessions; idempotent retry within a single session is permitted. Forensic anchor: 2026-05-05 23:11 operator's TWELFTH §6.L invocation: "when distributing new build it must have version code bigger by at least one then the last version code available for download (already distribited). Every distributed build MUST CONTAIN changelog with the details what it includes compared to previous one we have published!"

## Clause 6.Q (added 2026-05-05, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.Q — Compose Layout Antipattern Guard** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.Q. Forbids nesting vertically-scrolling lazy layouts (LazyColumn, LazyVerticalGrid, LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid) inside parents giving unbounded vertical space (verticalScroll, unbounded wrapContentHeight, LinearLayout-with-weight wrapper). Equivalent rule horizontally for LazyRow / LazyHorizontalGrid / LazyHorizontalStaggeredGrid. Per-feature structural tests + Compose UI Challenge Tests on the §6.I matrix are the load-bearing acceptance gates. Forensic anchor: 2026-05-05 23:51 operator-reported "Opening Trackers from Settings crashes the app" — TrackerSelectorList used LazyColumn nested in TrackerSettingsScreen's Column(verticalScroll). Closure log: `.lava-ci-evidence/crashlytics-resolved/2026-05-05-tracker-settings-nested-scroll.md`. Pattern guard: `feature/tracker_settings/src/test/.../TrackerSelectorListLazyColumnRegressionTest.kt`. The operator THIRTEENTH §6.L invocation triggered this clause.

## §6.R — No-Hardcoding Mandate (inherited 2026-05-06, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.R. No connection address, port, header field name, credential, key, salt, secret, schedule, algorithm parameter, or domain literal shall appear as a string/int constant in tracked source code. Every such value MUST come from `.env` (gitignored), generated config class, runtime env var, or mounted file. This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax.

## §6.S — Continuation Document Maintenance Mandate (inherited 2026-05-06, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.S. The file `docs/CONTINUATION.md` (in the parent Lava repo) is the single-file source-of-truth handoff document for resuming work across any CLI session. Every commit that changes phase status, lands a new spec/plan, bumps a submodule pin, ships a release artifact, discovers/resolves a known issue, or implements an operator scope directive MUST update `docs/CONTINUATION.md` in the SAME COMMIT. The §0 "Last updated" line MUST track HEAD. This submodule MAY add stricter rules (e.g., maintain its own CONTINUATION) but MUST NOT relax.

## §6.T — Universal Quality Constraints (inherited 2026-05-06, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.T. All four sub-points (Reproduction-Before-Fix, Resource Limits for Tests & Challenges, No-Force-Push, Bugfix Documentation) apply verbatim. This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax any of §6.T.1–§6.T.4.

## §6.U — No sudo/su Mandate (inherited 2026-05-08, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.U. Every use of `sudo` or `su` is strictly forbidden. Operations requiring elevated privileges MUST use container-based solutions from the `vasic-digital/Containers` submodule or be provided by local project/Submodule dependencies that build automatically. The pre-push hook rejects files containing `sudo ` or `su ` patterns. This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax.

## §6.V — Container Emulators Mandate (inherited 2026-05-08, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.V. Every Android emulator instance for Challenge Tests / UI verification MUST run inside a container managed by the `vasic-digital/Containers` submodule. Rootless Podman/Docker only. All tests execute inside containers. The §6.I matrix (API 28/30/34/latest, phone/tablet/TV) runs inside container-bound emulators. This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax.

## §6.W — GitHub + GitLab Only Remotes (inherited 2026-05-08, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.W. Only GitHub (`vasic-digital/*`, `HelixDevelopment/*`) and GitLab (`vasic-digital/*`, `HelixDevelopment/*`) are permitted as Git remotes. GitFlic, GitVerse, and all other providers are forbidden. The 4-mirror model is replaced by 2-mirror (GitHub + GitLab). This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax.

## §6.X — Container-Submodule Emulator Wiring Mandate (inherited 2026-05-13, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.X. Every Android emulator instance the project depends on for testing MUST execute its emulator process INSIDE a podman/docker container managed by `Submodules/Containers/`, NOT be host-direct-launched by Containers-submodule code that runs on the host. The Containers submodule's `pkg/runtime/` (rootless podman/docker auto-detection) brings the container up; `pkg/emulator/` orchestrates the AVD lifecycle inside it. Lava-side `scripts/run-emulator-tests.sh` is thin glue forwarding to the Containers CLI. The container-bound path is the gate — host-direct emulators are permitted for workstation iteration only. §6.X-debt tracks the wiring implementation owed to `Submodules/Containers/`. This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax.

## Article XI §11.9 — Anti-Bluff Forensic Anchor (cascaded from parent CONSTITUTION.md)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-04-29, reasserted multiple times across 2026-05): *"We had been in position that all tests do execute with success and all Challenges as well, but in reality the most of the features does not work and can't be used! This MUST NOT be the case and execution of tests and Challenges MUST guarantee the quality, the completion and full usability by end users of the product!"*

Operative rule: **The bar for shipping is not "tests pass" but "users can use the feature."** Every PASS in this codebase MUST carry positive runtime evidence captured during execution. Metadata-only / configuration-only / absence-of-error / grep-based PASS without runtime evidence are critical defects regardless of how green the summary line looks. No false-success results are tolerable.

This anchor MUST remain in this submodule's CONSTITUTION.md, CLAUDE.md, and AGENTS.md alongside CONST-047 — see the parent repository's `CONSTITUTION.md` for the full text.
## §6.Z — Anti-Bluff Distribute Guard (inherited 2026-05-14, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.Z. No artifact may be distributed (Firebase App Distribution, Google Play Store release, container image push, this submodule's binary release, any future channel) UNLESS the corresponding end-to-end tests have been **EXECUTED — not source-compiled, EXECUTED** — against the EXACT artifact about to be distributed, AND have **passed**. Pre-distribute test-evidence file required at `.lava-ci-evidence/distribute-changelog/<channel>/<version>-<code>-test-evidence.{md,json}` with matching commit SHA, timestamp within 24h, `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` (or per-language pass marker) verbatim in captured output. Cold-start verification is the load-bearing canary. Distributing a faulty version is a constitutional violation by construction. §6.Z-debt is open: mechanical enforcement via `scripts/firebase-distribute.sh` Phase 1 Gate 6 + pre-push hook check is documented but not yet enforced. Forensic anchor: 2026-05-14 Galaxy S23 Ultra cold-launch crash on Lava-Android-1.2.19-1039 (Crashlytics `40a62f97a5c65abb56142b4ca2c37eeb` — `painterResource()` rejection of `<layer-list>` drawable); agent had skipped Compose UI test execution citing the wrong §6.X caveat. Operator's 26th §6.L invocation: "Anti-bluff policy MUST BE ENFORCED ALWAYS!!!" This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax this clause.
## §6.AA — Two-Stage Distribute Mandate (inherited 2026-05-14, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.AA. When an artifact has both a debug and a release variant (or analogous dev-vs-prod build types — including this submodule's binary release if it ships separate dev / prod variants), distribute MUST happen in TWO STAGES with operator-confirmed verification between them. Stage 1 distributes the debug / dev variant only; the operator verifies the **distributed** debug variant on the failure-surface device class. Stage 2 distributes the release / prod variant only ONLY AFTER written stage-1 verification, with the §6.Z test-evidence file appended with a `release-stage` section. No combined distribute permitted by default; the combined path requires explicit per-cycle operator authorization recorded in the evidence file. The R8 / minification surprise class on Android (or analogous stripping / production-only optimization classes on other artifacts) is the load-bearing reason. §6.AA-debt is open: mechanical enforcement via `scripts/firebase-distribute.sh` default flip + refusal of out-of-order `--release-only` + paired `last-version-{debug,release}` per-channel pre-push check is documented but not yet enforced. Forensic anchor: 2026-05-14 operator directive immediately after the §6.Z forensic-anchor crash on Lava-Android-1.2.19-1039: "for purposes like this one we shall distribute via Firebase DEV / DEBUG version only. Once we try it, you continue and once all verified you distribute RELEASE too!" This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax this clause.
## §6.AB — Anti-Bluff Test-Suite Reinforcement (inherited 2026-05-14, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.AB. Every existing test + Challenge in this submodule MUST be auditable for the anti-bluff property "would this test fail if the user-visible behavior broke in a way a real user would notice?" Per-feature completeness checklist: rendering correctness (assert dominant color matches expected hue, not just RGB-variance), state-machine completeness (negative tests for forbidden transitions), gating logic (gate fires only on actual completion criterion). Bluff-hunt cadence escalation: every defect not caught by an existing test triggers a 5-file defect-driven hunt of adjacent tests, recorded under `.lava-ci-evidence/bluff-hunt/<date>-defect-driven-<slug>.json`. Discrimination test mandatory per Challenge Test: deliberately-broken-but-non-crashing production code MUST cause the Challenge Test to fail. Forensic anchor: 2026-05-14 Lava-Android-1.2.20-1040 white-icon + onboarding-gate-bypass — both passed all existing tests but failed for the user. Operator's 27th §6.L invocation: "all existing tests and Challenges do work in anti-bluff manner — they MUST confirm that all tested codebase really works as expected!" This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax this clause.
## §6.AC — Comprehensive Non-Fatal Telemetry Mandate (inherited 2026-05-14, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.AC. Every catch / error / fallback / unexpected-state path on every distributable artifact in this submodule MUST record a non-fatal telemetry event with sufficient context to triage the failure remotely. The Android-side canonical entry is `analytics.recordNonFatal(throwable, ctx)` / `analytics.recordWarning(message, ctx)` (lava.common.analytics.AnalyticsTracker); the Go-side equivalent is `observability.RecordNonFatal(ctx, err, attrs)`. Cancellation throwables are filtered automatically. Mandatory context: feature/module + operation + error_class + error_message (truncated 1024, no credentials per §6.H) + per-platform extras. Forbidden: silent fallbacks without telemetry; credentials/tokens/cookies/PII unredacted in event attributes. §6.AC-debt is open: Detekt + Go-vet rules flagging `try/catch` blocks lacking the telemetry call, pre-push hook integration. Forensic anchor: 2026-05-14 operator: "Add comprehensive Crashlytics non-fatals recording all over the apps and API so we can track in the background all warnings, issues and unexpected situations!" This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax this clause.


---
## CONST-048: Full-Automation-Coverage Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.25)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-15): *"Make sure that every feature, every functionality, every flow, every use case, every edge case, every service or application, on every platform we support is covered with full automation tests which will confirm anti-bluff policy and provide the proof of fully working capabilities, working implementation as expected, no issues, no bugs, fully documented, tests covered! Nothing less than this does not give us a chance to deliver stable product! This is mandatory constraint which MUST BE respected without ignoring, skipping, slacking or forgetting it!"*

No feature / functionality / flow / use case / edge case / service / application on any supported platform of HelixCode may be considered deliverable until covered by automation tests proving six invariants: (1) anti-bluff posture (CONST-035) with captured runtime evidence; (2) proof of working capability end-to-end on target topology (no mocks beyond unit tests — see CONST-050); (3) implementation matches documented promise; (4) no open issues/bugs surfaced — cross-checked against §11.4.15 / §11.4.16 trackers; (5) full documentation in sync per §11.4.12; (6) four-layer test floor per §1 (pre-build + post-build + runtime + paired mutation).

Consuming projects MUST publish a coverage ledger (feature × platform × invariant-1..6 × status) regenerated as part of the release-gate sweep. Gaps tracked per §11.4.15 (`UNCONFIRMED:` / `PENDING_FORENSICS:` / `OPERATOR-BLOCKED:` with §11.4.21 audit) — rows that quietly omit a platform are CONST-048 violations.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `CONST-048` ID reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Severity-equivalent to a §11.4 PASS-bluff at the release-gate layer. No escape hatch. See constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.25 for the full mandate.

## CONST-049: Constitution-Submodule Update Workflow Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.26)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-15): *"Every time we add something into our root (constitution Submodule) Constitution, CLAUDE.MD and AGENTS.MD we MUST FIRST fetch and pull all new changes / work from constitution Submodule first! All changes we apply MUST BE commited and pushed to all constitution Submodule upstreams! In case of conflict, IT MUST BE carefully resolved! Nothing can be broken, made faulty, corrupted or unusable! After merging full validation and verification MUST BE done!"*

Before ANY modification to `constitution/Constitution.md`, `constitution/CLAUDE.md`, or `constitution/AGENTS.md`, the agent or operator MUST execute the following 7-step pipeline in order:

1. **Fetch + pull first** inside the constitution submodule worktree — every configured remote fetched, then `git pull --ff-only` (or `--rebase` if non-FF; NEVER `--strategy=ours` / `--allow-unrelated-histories` without explicit authorization).
2. **Apply the change** with §11.4.17 classification + verbatim mandate quote.
3. **Validate before commit** — `meta_test_inheritance.sh` (or equivalent), no merge-conflict markers, cross-file consistency.
4. **Commit + push to ALL upstreams** — governance files only (NEVER `git add -A`); push to every configured remote. One-upstream commit = CONST-049 violation (also CONST-038/§6.W and §2.1).
5. **Conflict resolution** preserving union of governance content. Force-push to bypass conflicts is FORBIDDEN (CONST-043 / §9.2).
6. **Post-merge validation** — `git submodule update --remote --init` + re-run cascade verifier (CONST-047) confirming the new clause reaches every owned submodule.
7. **Bump consuming project pointer** — `.gitmodules`-tracked submodule pointer advanced to the new constitution HEAD in the SAME commit as cascade work.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `CONST-049` ID reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Severity-equivalent to a force-push without CONST-043 / §9.2 authorization. No escape hatch. See constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.26 for the full mandate.

## CONST-050: No-Fakes-Beyond-Unit-Tests + 100%-Test-Type-Coverage Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.27)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-15): *"Mocks, stubs, placeholders, TODOs or FIXMEs are allowed to exist ONLY in Unit tests! All other test types MUST interract with real fully implemented System! No fakes, empty implementations or bluffing is allowed of any kind! All codebase of the project MUST BE 100% covered with every supported test type: unit tests, integration tests, e2e tests, full automation tests, security tests, ddos tests, scaling tests, chaos tests, stress tests, performance tests, benchmarking tests, ui tests, ux tests, Challenges (fully incorporating our Challenges Submodule — https://github.com/vasic-digital/Challenges). EVERYTHING MUST BE tested using HelixQA (fully incorporating HelixQA Submodule — https://github.com/HelixDevelopment/HelixQA). HelixQA MUST BE used with all possible written tests suites (test banks) for every applications, service, platform, etc and execution of the full HelixQA QA autonomous sessions! All required dependency Submodules MUST BE added into the project as well (fully recursive!!!)."*

Two cooperating invariants:

**(A) No-fakes-beyond-unit-tests.** Mocks, stubs, fakes, placeholders, `TODO`, `FIXME`, "for now", "in production this would", or empty-implementation patterns are PERMITTED only in unit-test sources (`*_test.go` files invoked without the integration build tag; `HelixCode/tests/unit/`; etc.). Every other test type — integration, E2E, full automation, security, DDoS, scaling, chaos, stress, performance, benchmarking, UI, UX, Challenges, HelixQA — MUST exercise the real, fully implemented HelixCode system against real infrastructure (real PostgreSQL, real Redis, real LLM endpoints, real containers, real captured devices). Production code (anything under `HelixCode/cmd/`, `HelixCode/applications/`, `HelixCode/internal/<pkg>/<file>.go` not ending `_test.go`) MUST NOT import from `HelixCode/internal/mocks/`.

**(B) 100% test-type coverage.** HelixCode's codebase MUST be covered by every supported test type the domain warrants:
- **Unit** — fast, isolated, mocks permitted per (A).
- **Integration** — multi-component, no mocks, real backing services.
- **End-to-end (E2E)** — full user-flow exercise on target topology.
- **Full automation** — orchestrated suites exercising every feature × platform combination (CONST-048 coverage ledger).
- **Security** — authn/authz boundaries, CONST-042 secret-leak scans, input-fuzzing, dependency-CVE scanning, threat-model verification.
- **DDoS** — request-flood resilience at advertised throughput tier.
- **Scaling** — horizontal + vertical scale behaviour under linear load growth.
- **Chaos** — controlled failure injection (network partition, process kill, disk full, clock skew).
- **Stress** — sustained load above advertised tier.
- **Performance** — latency / throughput / tail-latency invariants vs SLO baselines.
- **Benchmarking** — micro + macro suites with historical p95-drift detection.
- **UI** — visual-regression + DOM-state + interaction-flow coverage on every target platform's UI surface.
- **UX** — flow-correctness + accessibility + i18n + visual-cue ordering (§11.4.23 composition).
- **Challenges** — `vasic-digital/Challenges` submodule (at `./Challenges/`) fully incorporated; per-feature Challenge scripts with captured runtime evidence.
- **HelixQA** — `HelixDevelopment/HelixQA` submodule (at `./HelixQA/`) fully incorporated; ALL written test banks executed; full autonomous QA sessions run as part of release gates with captured wire evidence per check.

**Required dependency submodules** (recursive per CONST-047):
- Challenges — `git@github.com:vasic-digital/Challenges.git` — incorporated at `./Challenges/`.
- HelixQA — `git@github.com:HelixDevelopment/HelixQA.git` — incorporated at `./HelixQA/`.
- Any additional functionality submodules under `vasic-digital/*` / `HelixDevelopment/*` orgs that HelixCode depends on — incorporate rather than duplicate work the orgs already maintain.

Submodule pointers MUST be bumped to upstream HEAD in the SAME commit as any dependent cascade work (CONST-049 step 7). Pointer drift = CONST-050 violation.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `CONST-050` ID reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Severity-equivalent to a §11.4 PASS-bluff at the release-gate layer. No escape hatch. See constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.27 for the full mandate.

## CONST-051: Submodules-As-Equal-Codebase + Decoupling + Dependency-Layout Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.28)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-15): *"All existing Submodules in the project that we are controlling and belong to some our organizations (vasic-digital, HelixDevelopment, red-elf, ATMOSphere1234321, Bear-Suite, BoatOS123456, Helix-Flow, Helix-Track, Server-Factory - we can ALWAYS check dynamically using GitHub and GitLab CLIs) are equal parts of the project's codebase! We MUST work on that code as much as we do with main project's codebase! All on equal basis! Equally important! We MUST take it into the account, analyze it, extend it, create missing tests, do full testing of it, fill the gaps (if any), fix any issues that we discover or they pop-up, write and extend the documentation, user guides, manulas, diagrams, graphs, SQL definitions, Website(s) and all other relevant materials! We MUST NEVER modify Submodules to bring into them any project specific context since they all MUST BE ALWAYS fully decoupled, project not-aware, fully reusable and modular (by any other project(s)), completely testable! All Submodule dependencies that are used by Submodule MUST BE acessed from the root of the project! We MUST NOT have nested Submodule dependencies but accessing each from proper location from the root of the project - directly from project's root project_name/submodule_name or some more proper structure project_name/submodules/submodule_name!"*

Three cooperating invariants apply to every HelixCode-owned submodule (those whose upstream `origin` lives under `vasic-digital`, `HelixDevelopment`, `red-elf`, `ATMOSphere1234321`, `Bear-Suite`, `BoatOS123456`, `Helix-Flow`, `Helix-Track`, `Server-Factory`, or any subsequently authorised org):

**(A) Equal-codebase.** Every owned-by-us submodule is an **equal part** of HelixCode's codebase. The same engineering practice — analysis, extension, test creation, gap-filling, bug-fix, documentation (user manuals, guides, diagrams, graphs, SQL definitions, website pages, all materials) — applies to each owned submodule on equal basis. A round of work that improves only HelixCode's main while leaving an owned-submodule deficiency unaddressed is a CONST-051 violation, severity-equivalent to a §11.4 PASS-bluff at the project-scope layer. The §11.4.25 / CONST-048 coverage ledger MUST list every owned submodule as an in-scope target.

**(B) Decoupling / reusability.** Owned submodules MUST remain fully decoupled from HelixCode (and any other consuming project). No HelixCode-specific context, hardcoded paths, hostnames, asset names, or runtime assumptions may be introduced into an owned submodule's source tree. When a submodule needs information from HelixCode, the honest path is configuration injection (env var, config file, constructor parameter) — never a hardcoded reach into the parent's tree. Every owned submodule MUST be project-not-aware, fully reusable, modular, and completely testable as a standalone repository.

**(C) Dependency-layout.** Every dependency that an owned submodule consumes MUST be accessible from HelixCode's root at one of two canonical paths:
- `<repo_root>/<submodule_name>/` (flat layout — current HelixCode layout for Challenges, HelixQA, Containers, Security, etc.)
- `<repo_root>/submodules/<submodule_name>/` (grouped layout — alternate)

**Nested own-org submodule chains are FORBIDDEN.** A submodule MUST NOT have its own `.gitmodules` entries pulling in further owned-by-us repos. Every dependency required by submodule X is added to HelixCode's root at the canonical path; X reaches it via documented import / SDK path / runtime resolver — never via its own nested submodule pointer. Third-party submodules (not under our orgs) are exempt — they MAY appear at any depth.

The owned-org list is dynamically discoverable at any time via `gh org list` / `glab` CLIs or the orgs' public APIs.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `CONST-051` ID reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Severity-equivalent to a §11.4 PASS-bluff at the codebase-completeness layer. No escape hatch. See constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.28 for the full mandate (audit gates, mutation pairs, workflow integration).

*This Constitution is the supreme law of the HelixCode project. No code, test, or process may contradict it.*


## CONST-052: Lowercase-Snake_Case-Naming Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.29)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-15): *"naming convention for Submodules and directories (applied deep into hierarchy recursively) - all directories and Submodules MSUT HAVE lowercase names with space separator between the words of '_' character (snake-case)! All existing Submodules and directories which are not following this rule MUST BE renamed! However, since this will most likely break some of the functionalities renaming we do MUST BE applied to all references to particular Submodule or directory! ... There MUST BE reasonable exceptions for this rules - source code for programming languages or Submodules which apply different naming convention - Android, Java, Kotlin and others. ... Upstreams directory which all of our projects and Submodules have MUST BE renamed to the lowercase letters too, however root project containing the install_upstreams system command (it is exported in out paths in our .bashrc or .zshrc) MUST BE updated to fully work with both Upstreams and upstreams directory. ... NOTE: Rules lowercase / snake-case do apply to all project files as well and references to it and from them!"*

Every directory, submodule, and file in HelixCode MUST use lowercase snake_case names. Existing non-compliant names (`HelixCode/`, `Challenges/`, `Containers/`, `HelixAgent/`, `HelixQA/`, `Security/`, `Github-Pages-Website/`, `Upstreams/`, `Dependencies/`, etc.) MUST be renamed as part of the phased migration opened by this clause. Every reference (configs, docs, links, source-code imports, governance files) MUST be updated atomically with the rename — reference drift after a rename is a CONST-052 violation of equal severity to the rename itself.

**Common-sense exceptions (technology-preserving):** language-mandated case for Java/Kotlin/Android/Apple/C#/Swift INSIDE the language root (submodule root follows our convention; subtree follows language convention); vendor/upstream third-party submodules keep upstream names; build artefacts (`node_modules`, `__pycache__`, `.git`, `target`, `build`, `bin`) keep tool-mandated names. The test "does renaming break the technology?" trumps the rule.

**`Upstreams/` → `upstreams/` transition:** the constitution submodule's `install_upstreams.sh` (exported via `.bashrc`/`.zshrc`) supports BOTH `Upstreams/` and `upstreams/` directory layouts (commit `45d3678` of the constitution submodule); lowercase wins when both present.

**Test coverage of renames** (per CONST-050(B)): every rename batch ships with (i) regression test verifying every reference now resolves, (ii) full test-type matrix run post-rename, (iii) anti-bluff wire-evidence captured.

**Phased execution** per the operator's explicit instruction: comprehensive brainstorming → phase-divided plan → fine-grained tasks/subtasks → every change covered by every applicable test type. §11.4.20 subagent delegation for cross-cutting rename sweeps.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `CONST-052` ID reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Severity-equivalent to a §11.4 PASS-bluff at the reference-integrity layer. No escape hatch beyond the common-sense exceptions enumerated above. See constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.29 for the full mandate.


## CONST-053: .gitignore + No-Versioned-Build-Artifacts Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.30)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-15): *"every project module, every Submodule, every servcie and apolication MUST HAVE proper .gitignore file! We MUST NOT git version build artifacts, cache files, tmp files, main .env file(s) or any files containing sensitive data, API keys or token! Any build derivate which we can recreate by executing proper mechanism for generating MUST NOT be versioned! We MUST pay attention what is going to be commited every time we are preparing to execute commit! If any violetion is detected it MUST be fixed before commit is executed!"*

Every project module, owned-by-us submodule, service, and application MUST ship a proper `.gitignore`. Forbidden-from-version-control classes:

1. **Build artefacts**: `/bin/`, `/build/`, `/dist/`, `/out/`, `target/`, `*.exe`, `*.dll`, `*.so`, `*.dylib`, `*.a`, `*.o`, `*.class`, `*.pyc`, generator-produced files when the generator is committed.
2. **Cache files**: `__pycache__/`, `.pytest_cache/`, `.mypy_cache/`, `.ruff_cache/`, `node_modules/`, `.next/`, `.cache/`, `.gradle/`, `.terraform/`, language-server caches.
3. **Temp files**: `*.tmp`, `*.swp`, `*~`, `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, `*.orig`, `*.rej`.
4. **Sensitive-data files**: `.env`, `.env.*` (allow `.env.example` placeholder only — no real secrets even as examples), `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.crt`, `id_rsa*`, `id_ed25519*`, `.netrc`, `secrets/`, `api_keys.sh`.
5. **Generated reports/logs**: `*.log`, `coverage.out`, `htmlcov/`, runtime captures unless reference assets.
6. **OS/IDE personal state**: `.idea/`, `.history/`, `.vscode/` (except shared settings).

**Anti-bluff invariant**: `.gitignore` line alone is not sufficient — no file matching the forbidden patterns may be CURRENTLY TRACKED. A tracked `*.log` despite the ignore-line is a violation of equal severity to no ignore-line at all.

**Pre-commit attention**: every commit author (human OR agent) MUST inspect `git diff --staged` + `git status` BEFORE executing the commit. Forbidden-class hits abort the commit until fixed (un-stage, add to `.gitignore`, scrub if already-tracked). Gate `CM-GITIGNORE-PRECOMMIT-AUDIT` + paired mutation.

**Secret-leak intersection (CONST-042 / §11.4.10):** a `.env` leak is BOTH a CONST-053 and a CONST-042 violation; rotation + post-mortem required.

**Recreatable-content test**: if a documented mechanism regenerates the file from sources, it is a build derivative and MUST be ignored. The committed sources MUST include the generator.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `CONST-053` ID reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Severity-equivalent to a §11.4 PASS-bluff at the repository-hygiene layer. See constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.30 for the full mandate.


## CONST-054: Submodule-Dependency-Manifest Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.31)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-15): *"We MUST HAVE mechanism for each Submodule to determine / know what are its Submodule dependencies so new projects or palces we are incorporate them can add these Submodules to the project root and make them available! Suggested idea is configuration file with expected Submodules Git ssh urls perhaps? New project can read it, and recursively add each Submodule to the root of the project and install / expose it to veryone."*

Every owned-by-us submodule MUST ship `helix-deps.yaml` at its root declaring its own-org dependencies. Schema: `schema_version`, `deps: [{name, ssh_url, ref, why, layout: flat|grouped}]`, `transitive_handling.{recursive,conflict_resolution}`, `language_specific_subtree`. Tooling: `incorporate-submodule <ssh-url>` adds the submodule at the parent project's canonical path (CONST-051(C)), reads `helix-deps.yaml`, recurses for each declared dep, aborts on conflicting refs, emits `<root>/.helix-manifest.yaml` audit record.

Anti-bluff guarantee: every manifest paired with a Challenge that bootstraps a throwaway consuming project, runs `incorporate-submodule`, asserts produced layout matches the manifest, runs the submodule's own tests against the bootstrapped layout, captures wire evidence per §11.4.2. A manifest without this proof is a CONST-054 violation.

§11.4.31 / CONST-054 is the **operational complement** of CONST-051(C): nested own-org submodule chains are FORBIDDEN — manifests are the bridge that lets consumers reconstruct the dependency graph at the parent root.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `CONST-054` ID reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Severity-equivalent to §11.4 PASS-bluff at the dependency-graph layer. See constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.31 for the full mandate.

## CONST-055: Post-Constitution-Pull Validation Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.32)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-15): *"Every time we fetch and pull new changes on constitution Submodule we MUST process the whole project and all Submodule (deep recursively) for validation and verification taht every single rule or mandatory constraint is followed and respected! If it is not, IT MUST BE!"*

Whenever a project's constitution submodule is fetched + pulled with any content change, the project MUST run `scripts/verify-all-constitution-rules.sh` BEFORE the new constitution HEAD is treated as canonical for any other work. The sweep re-runs the governance-cascade verifier AND every implementable rule gate (CONST-053 `.gitignore` audit, CONST-051(C) nested-own-org-chain audit, CONST-052 case audit, CONST-050(A) mock-from-production audit, CONST-035 anti-bluff smoke, etc.) against the post-pull tree. Failures populate the project's Issues tracker per §11.4.15 (Status: `Reopened`, Type: `Bug`); closure requires positive-evidence per §11.4.

Pull-time invocation: `git submodule update --remote constitution` triggers the sweep automatically (post-update hook OR commit-wrapper invocation). Operator-explicit manual invocation also available.

Anti-bluff: the sweep's own meta-test (paired mutation per §1.1) plants a known violation of each enforced gate and asserts the sweep reports FAIL for the planted gate. A sweep that exits PASS without running every implementable gate is a CONST-055 violation.

CONST-055 is the **enforcement engine** for every other §11.4.x and CONST-NNN rule — without it, new rules cascade as anchors but never get enforced.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `CONST-055` ID reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Severity-equivalent to §11.4 PASS-bluff at the constitutional-enforcement layer. See constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.32 for the full mandate.


## CONST-056: Mandatory install_upstreams on clone/add Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.36)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-15): *"Every Submodule or Git repository we add or clone MUST BE upstreams installed using Upstreamable utility which MUST BE available through exported paths of the host system (in .bashrc or .zhrc) using install_upstreams command executed from the root of the cloned (added) repository - only if in it is Upstreams or upstreams directory present with bash script files (recipes) for all repository's upstreams!"*

Every clone / add of a Git repository under HelixCode MUST be followed by `install_upstreams` invocation from the repository's root IF its tree contains `upstreams/` (or legacy `Upstreams/` per CONST-052 transition) populated with `*.sh` recipe files. The utility (installed on operator's `PATH` via `.bashrc`/`.zshrc`; implementation in the constitution submodule's `install_upstreams.sh` — already supports BOTH directory names since constitution commit `45d3678`) reads the recipe files, configures every declared upstream as a named git remote, and fans out `origin` push URLs.

Skipping the invocation when `upstreams/` is present silently breaks §2.1 (multi-upstream push is the norm) — the next push lands on only one upstream. Gate `CM-INSTALL-UPSTREAMS-ON-CLONE` + paired mutation. Automation: the future `incorporate-submodule` per CONST-054 auto-invokes; manual invocation supported. Pre-commit check: `git remote -v | grep -c push` reports expected count.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `CONST-056` ID reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. See constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.36 for the full mandate.


## CONST-057: Type-aware Closure-Status Vocabulary (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.33)

Every project tracking work items by Type per §11.4.16 MUST close them with the Type-appropriate terminal `**Status:**` value, drawn from this 3-element closed map:

| Item `**Type:**` | Closure `**Status:**` value     |
|------------------|---------------------------------|
| `Bug`            | `Fixed (→ Fixed.md)`            |
| `Feature`        | `Implemented (→ Fixed.md)`      |
| `Task`           | `Completed (→ Fixed.md)`        |

The `(→ Fixed.md)` suffix is preserved across all three so the existing migration-discipline tooling (atomic Issues.md → Fixed.md move per §11.4.19) keeps working without per-Type branching. Generators (`generate_issues_summary.sh`, `generate_fixed_summary.sh`, the §11.4.23 colorizer) MUST treat the three terminal values as semantically equivalent (all "closed, positive evidence captured") while preserving the literal in the emitted document.

Closing a `Feature` with `Fixed (→ Fixed.md)` or a `Task` with `Implemented (→ Fixed.md)` is a CONST-057 violation. Gate `CM-CLOSURE-VOCAB-TYPE-AWARE` walks every Fixed.md heading + every Issues.md heading whose `**Status:**` is one of the three terminal values and asserts the Status-Type match. Composes with §11.4.15 / §11.4.16 / §11.4.19 / §11.4.23.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `CONST-057` ID reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. See constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.33 for the full mandate.

## CONST-058: Reopened-Source Attribution Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.34)

Every Issues.md (or equivalent project tracker) heading whose `**Status:**` is `Reopened` MUST carry, within 8 non-blank lines of the heading, a `**Reopened-Details:**` line capturing four sub-facts:

- **By:** `AI` or `User` (source-of-truth observer who flipped the status). `AI` covers in-loop reopens (test failure, gate regression, captured-evidence retrospect). `User` covers operator-side observations (manual testing, end-user report, design reconsideration).
- **On:** ISO date (`YYYY-MM-DD`).
- **Reason:** one-line cause classification — chosen from the closed vocabulary `{ test-failed | manual-testing-detected | captured-evidence-contradicts | end-user-report | cycle-re-discovered | design-reconsidered }`. Other values permitted with explicit `Reason: <free text>` annotation but the closed list MUST be tried first.
- **Evidence:** path to or short description of the captured artefact justifying the reopen — log file, recording, gate failure ID, operator quote, etc. Reopens without evidence are §11.4.6 / §11.4.7 violations (demotion from Fixed requires captured evidence under the conditions that re-exposed the defect).

The Issues_Summary.md Status column MUST distinguish the four `Reopened` sub-states by source so a sweep query for "reopens by AI in the last 30 days" is mechanically possible. Suggested column rendering: `Reopened (AI: test-failed)` vs `Reopened (User: manual-testing)`. Gate `CM-ITEM-REOPENED-DETAILS` mirrors `CM-ITEM-OPERATOR-BLOCKED-DETAILS` (§11.4.21 walk pattern). Composes with §11.4.6 / §11.4.7 / §11.4.15 / §11.4.21.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `CONST-058` ID reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. See constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.34 for the full mandate.

## CONST-059: Canonical-Root Inheritance Clarity (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.35)

The **constitution submodule's** three files (`constitution/Constitution.md`, `constitution/CLAUDE.md`, `constitution/AGENTS.md`) ARE the **canonical root** (also called the **parent** files). They contain only universal rules per §11.4.17.

The consuming project's **repository-root files** (`<project-root>/CLAUDE.md`, `<project-root>/AGENTS.md`, optionally `<project-root>/Constitution.md`) are **consumer extensions**. They MUST start with the inheritance pointer (either the Claude-Code native `@constitution/CLAUDE.md` import or the portable `## INHERITED FROM constitution/CLAUDE.md` heading). They contain only project-specific rules per §11.4.17.

**When in doubt about which file to edit:** universal rule → constitution submodule's file; project-specific rule → consumer's file. Default consumer-side when uncertain (§11.4.17 — narrower scope is cheap to widen).

**Terminology:** "the parent CLAUDE.md" / "the root Constitution" → constitution-submodule file at `constitution/<filename>`; "the project CLAUDE.md" / "this project's AGENTS.md" → consumer-side file at `<project-root>/<filename>`.

**No silent demotion or silent promotion.** Moving a rule between layers MUST be a visible commit — `git mv` of a section if it's a clean clone, or explicit `Lifted from <project> to constitution per §11.4.35` / `Demoted from constitution to <project> per §11.4.35` commit-message annotation.

Gate `CM-CANONICAL-ROOT-CLARITY` verifies (a) consumer's `CLAUDE.md` opens with the inheritance pointer, (b) constitution submodule's three files are present at the expected path, (c) no `## INHERITED FROM` block in the constitution submodule's own files (those ARE the source-of-truth, not consumers). Composes with §11.4.17.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `CONST-059` ID reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. See constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.35 for the full mandate.

## CONST-060: Fetch-before-edit Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.37)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-15): *"Make sure that feedback_fetch_before_edit memory rule is part of our constitution Submodule - the root Consitution, AGENTS.MD and CLAUDE.MD. Validate and verify that Proejct-Toolkit and all Submodules do inherit all of them! Follow the constitution Submodule documentation for details."*

The FIRST git-touching action of every session, on every consuming project (owned or third-party), MUST be:

```bash
git fetch --all --prune
git log --oneline HEAD..@{u}
git submodule foreach --recursive 'git fetch --all --prune --quiet'
```

If `HEAD..@{u}` is non-empty, integrate the upstream changes BEFORE any local edit. Acting on stale local state produces three failure modes documented in the originating §11.4.37 incident (multi-agent / parallel-session work): (1) **redundant work** — the agent re-does what a parallel session already finished, (2) **false confidence** — completion reports for already-done work, (3) **divergent history** — duplicate sibling commits that double the conflict surface on next push.

**Anti-bluff invariant**: the fetch+log check MUST produce captured evidence — the actual `HEAD..@{u}` output, even if empty. Skipping the check on the basis of "I just fetched" or "nothing could have changed in the last N minutes" is a §11.4.6 (no-guessing) violation: the remote state is not knowable without a fetch.

**Cascade requirement**: This anchor (verbatim or by `CONST-060` ID reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Severity-equivalent to §11.4 PASS-bluff at the parallel-session-coordination layer. See constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.37 for the full mandate.

## CONST-061: Pre-Force-Push Merge-First Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.41)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-17): *"make sure we bring everything from branches to our side before forc push is done! Afer everything is safely and fully merged and all potential conflicts (if any) resolved, then do force push! make sure nothing isnlost, broken or corrupted on bith sides! add these rules in our root Constitution, CLAUDE.MD, AGENTS.MD (constitution Submodule) if itnis not added already! Extremely important rules and mandatory constraints we MUST HAVE and fully respect!"*

Any force-push (`--force`, `--force-with-lease`, `+<ref>`, equivalent history-rewrite) authorised under CONST-043 MUST be preceded by a mechanical 4-step merge-first pipeline:

1. **Fetch every remote** — `git fetch --all --prune --tags` against origin + every upstream; capture output.
2. **Integrate every divergent commit locally** — rebase / merge / operator-confirmed cherry-pick per appropriate strategy for every non-empty `HEAD..<remote>/<branch>` range.
3. **Audit the integrated tree** — no conflict markers anywhere (`grep -rn '^<<<<<<< \|^=======$\|^>>>>>>> '` returns empty in governance + source + test files); no file silently dropped; previously-passing tests still pass; captured-evidence artefacts still validate.
4. **Force-push** — only after steps 1-3 produce clean integration evidence: `git push --force-with-lease` (NEVER `--force` alone unless authorised per §9.2 sub-clause 6).

**Two-gate composition with CONST-043.** §11.4.41 does NOT relax CONST-043's operator-approval requirement — it adds a SECOND mechanical gate. CONST-043 alone authorises a push that loses remote work; §11.4.41 alone risks pushing without operator awareness. Both required.

**Three failure modes prevented:** (a) remote-side content loss when parallel sessions land work between fetches; (b) stale-state acts when `--force-with-lease` reads stale local refs without prior fetch; (c) conflict-driven corruption when markers get committed verbatim (observed 2026-05-17 in helix_qa + containers governance files).

**Verification artefact**: every governed force-push emits a `docs/changelogs/<tag>.md` "Force-push merge-first audit" section capturing fetch output, per-remote divergence log, integration strategy, conflict-marker scan, test delta, push output with lease SHA, + CONST-043 authorisation quote. Gate `CM-FORCE-PUSH-MERGE-FIRST` + paired mutation.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `CONST-061` ID reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Severity-equivalent to a §11.4 PASS-bluff at the remote-data-integrity layer. See constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.41 for the full mandate.

## CONST-068: Shell-script target-shell-parseability mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.67)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-19): *"any issue we spot must be fixed, bash scripts as well if they are broken!"* + *"Make sure that this is mandatory rule!"*

> Verbatim 2026-05-19 operator mandate: *"all existing tests and Challenges do work in anti-bluff manner - they MUST confirm that all tested codebase really works as expected! We had been in position that all tests do execute with success and all Challenges as well, but in reality the most of the features does not work and can't be used! This MUST NOT be the case and execution of tests and Challenges MUST guarantee the quality, the completition and full usability by end users of the product!"*

Every committed shell script MUST be parseable by its target interpreter (`sh -n` for `/bin/sh`, `bash -n` for `/bin/bash`, etc.) AND MUST declare a shebang matching its actual syntax usage. Bash-only constructs (`>(...)`, `<(...)`, `[[ ]]`, `<<<`, arrays, `${var^^}`, etc.) used in scripts that may be invoked via `sh script.sh` MUST be wrapped in `eval` so the parser sees only a string (target shells like mksh parse the entire script before executing — runtime guards cannot save a parse-time rejection). Honest shebangs only: `#!/bin/bash` only if bash actually expected; `#!/bin/sh` requires POSIX-clean body. Fix at source per §11.4.1, never at callsites. Composes with §11.4.1 / §11.4.4 / §11.4.6 / §11.4.50 / §11.4.51. Pre-build gate `CM-SCRIPT-TARGET-SHELL-PARSEABLE` runs `sh -n` on every in-scope script. No escape hatch — no `--skip-parseability-check`, `--bash-only-script`, `--runtime-guard-suffices` flag.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `CONST-068` ID reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. See constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.67 for the full mandate.
