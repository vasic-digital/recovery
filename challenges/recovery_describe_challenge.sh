#!/usr/bin/env bash
# recovery_describe_challenge.sh — round-280 anti-bluff wrapper
# around the in-process Challenge runner (challenges/runner/main.go).
#
# Two-mode behaviour (CONST-050(A) paired-mutation; §1.1):
#
#   normal:    exits 0 only when the runner exits 0 (every invariant
#              passes). Any deviation FAILs.
#
#   mutate:    sets RECOVERY_MUTATE_RUNNER=1 which inverts invariant 2
#              inside the runner (treats never-tripping breaker as PASS).
#              The runner MUST then exit non-zero; this wrapper rewrites
#              that non-zero exit to 99 (paired-mutation success). If the
#              runner exits 0 under mutation, this wrapper FAILs —
#              proving the runner actually checks what it claims to
#              check, not a metadata-only PASS.
#
# Verbatim 2026-05-19 operator mandate (preserved per
# CONST-049 §11.4.17):
#   "all existing tests and Challenges do work in anti-bluff
#    manner - they MUST confirm that all tested codebase really
#    works as expected! We had been in position that all tests
#    do execute with success and all Challenges as well, but
#    in reality the most of the features does not work and
#    can't be used! This MUST NOT be the case and execution
#    of tests and Challenges MUST guarantee the quality, the
#    completition and full usability by end users of the
#    product!"
